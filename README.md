Premier League Top 6 team statistics

With the Premier League Season Finally coming to an end and Liverpool crowned champions after 30 years let us get an overview of how the top 6 teams performed through these visualizations.
First the visualizations will go through the league table and major award winning players for the season and their stats which won them the laureates.

Then we will transition to comapring the goals scored for and against all the teams and their goal difference will be listed on the chart. This part will also feature a detailed look on how top 6 teams performed based on the expected goals (for and against) and the actual goals scored and conceded.

After going through the goal analysis we will focus on shots taken which lead to these goals and also look at the conversion rates of the top 6 teams.
In football we know attack is the best defence but the goal keepers and the defenders also play a huge part in the game so charts in this section shows the defensive contribution and team discipline.

Finally I have created an interactive Dashboard which will show top performers from each team and their contribution.
Finally the beautiful game is back after a roadblock posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Glossary

Expected Goals (xG)
Very simply, xG (or expected goals) is the probability that a shot will result in a goal based on the characteristics of that shot and the events leading up to it.Every shot is compared to thousands of shots with similar characteristics to determine the probability that this shot will result in a goal.

Similarly Expected Goals Against (xGA) is the probability that a opponent shot will result in a Goal.

Conversion Rate 
It is the percentage of shots taken(not necesarily on target) by a player which resulted in a goal.
[Goals Scored / Shots ] x 100
